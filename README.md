# Pizza Sales Dashboard

### Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Pizza Sales Dashboard** project. This interactive Power BI dashboard provides insights into pizza sales trends, helping answer key business questions like customer demand, peak hours, bestseller pizzas, and overall revenue.

I developed this dashboard to showcase how data visualization can drive actionable insights for a business. The visualized data is critical for improving menu offerings, running promotional campaigns, and understanding customer preferences.

### Dashboard Features
- **Total Sales and Orders:** Visualize total revenue, number of orders, and other key performance indicators.
- **Sales by Month:** Identifies trends and seasonality in pizza sales throughout the year.
- **Peak Hours and Busy Days:** Displays when customers place the most orders and highlights peak business hours.
- **Popular Categories and Sizes:** Breakdown of pizza category (e.g., Supreme, Veggie) and preferred sizes.
- **Bottom 5 Pizzas:** Identifies underperforming menu items, helping to make decisions about potential menu changes or promotions.

### Key Business Questions Answered

  - On average, **60 orders** are placed per day.

  - The busiest time periods are between **12 PM - 3 PM** and **6 PM - 9 PM**.

- **What are the top-selling pizza categories and sizes?**
  - **Classic** and **Supreme** are the most popular categories, and size **L** is the top choice for customers.
- **How much revenue did we make this year?**
  - Total sales amount to **$817,860.05** over the year.

### Tools and Technologies Used
